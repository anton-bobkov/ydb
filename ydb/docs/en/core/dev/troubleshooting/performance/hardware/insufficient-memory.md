# Insufficient memory (RAM)

If [swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging#Unix_and_Unix-like_systems) (paging of anonymous memory) is disabled on the server running {{ ydb-short-name }}, insufficient memory activates another kernel feature called the [OOM killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory), which terminates the most memory-intensive processes (often the database itself). This feature also interacts with [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) if multiple cgroups are configured.

If swap is enabled, insufficient memory may cause the database to rely heavily on disk I/O, which is significantly slower than accessing data directly from memory. This can result in increased latencies during query execution and data retrieval.

Additionally, which components within the  {{ ydb-short-name }} process consume memory may also be significant.

## Diagnostics

1. Determine whether any {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes recently restarted for unknown reasons. Exclude cases of {{ ydb-short-name }} upgrades.

    1. Open [Embedded UI](../../../../reference/embedded-ui/index.md).

    1. On the **Nodes** tab, look for nodes that have low uptime.

1. Determine whether memory usage reached 100%.

    1. Open the **DB overview** dashboard in Grafana.

    1. Analyze the charts in the **Memory** section.

1. Determine whether the user load on {{ ydb-short-name }} has increased. Analyze the following charts on the **DB overview** dashboard in Grafana:

    - **Requests** chart
    - **Request size** chart
    - **Response size** chart

1. Determine whether new releases or data usage changes occurred in your applications.

## Recommendation

Consider the following solutions to the problem of insufficient memory:

- If the load on {{ ydb-short-name }} increased because of new usage patterns or higher volume of queries, try to optimize the application to reduce the load on {{ ydb-short-name }} or add more {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes.

- If the load on {{ ydb-short-name }} has not changed, but {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes still restart, consider adding more {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes or raising the [hard memory limit](../../../../deploy/configuration/config.md#hard-memory-limit) available to {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes.
