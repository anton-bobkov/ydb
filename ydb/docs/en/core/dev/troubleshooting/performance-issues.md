# Performance issues

Database performance issues can be classified into several categories based on their nature:

- **Insufficient resources**. These issues refer to situations when the workload demands more physical resources — such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth — than allocated to a database.

- **Schema design issues**. These issues stem from inefficient decisions made during the creation of tables and indices. They can significantly impact query performance.

- **Query-related issues**. These issues refer to database queries executing slower than expected because of their inefficient design.
