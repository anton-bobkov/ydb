# Performance issues

Database performance issues can be classified into several categories based on their nature:

- **Reaching resource limits**. These issues refer to situations when the physical resources allocated to a database system — such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth — are insufficient to handle the demands of the workload.

- **Schema design issues**. These issues refer to inefficient decisions that were made during the creation of database schemas. Such issues can significantly impact database performance.

- **Query performance issues**. These issues refer to problems that arise when database queries execute slower that expected because of their inefficient design.
