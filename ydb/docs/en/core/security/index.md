# {{ ydb-short-name }} for Security Engineers

This section of {{ ydb-short-name }} documentation covers security-related aspects of working with {{ ydb-short-name }}. It'll be useful for compliance purposes too.

## {{ ydb-short-name }} security elements and concepts

Security model in {{ ydb-short-name }} introduces the following concepts:

![Eagle-view diagram](./_assets/security-overview.png)

- **Access subjects**:

    - **Users**. {{ ydb-short-name }} supports both internal [users](./authorization.md#user) and external users from third-party directory services, such as LDAP and IAM systems.

    - **Groups**. {{ ydb-short-name }} allows grouping users into named collections. The list of users in a group can be modified later. A group can be empty.

- **Access objects** in {{ ydb-short-name }} are scheme objects (tables, views, etc) for which access rights are configured.

- **Access rights** and **access levels** in {{ ydb-short-name }} are used to determine the list of permitted operations for a given user or group:

    - Access rights represent permission for an access subject to perform a specific set of operations (create, drop, select, update, etc) in a cluster or database on a specific access object. For more information about access rights, see [{#T}](./authorization.md#right).

    - {{ ydb-short-name }} uses [access levels](../concepts/glossary.md#access-level) to manage [access subject](../concepts/glossary.md#access-subject) privileges that are not related to [scheme objects](../concepts/glossary.md#scheme-object). For more information about access levels, see [{#T}](../reference/configuration/security_config.md#security-access-levels).

    Access rights and access levels can be granted to a user or a group. When a user is added to a group, the user gets the access rights and access levels that were granted to the group. When a user is removed from a group, the user loses the access rights and access levels of the group.

- **[Authentication](./authentication.md) and [authorization](./authorization.md)**. The access control system in {{ ydb-short-name }} provides data protection in a {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster. Due to the access system, only authorized [access subjects](../concepts/glossary.md#access-subject) (users and groups) can work with data. Access to data can be restricted.

    - **Authentication**. When a [user](../concepts/glossary.md#access-user) connects to a {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster, {{ ydb-short-name }} first identifies the user's account. This process is called [authentication](./authentication.md). {{ ydb-short-name }} supports various authentication modes. For more information, see [Authentication](./authentication.md).

        Regardless of an authentication mode, after passing [authentication](./authentication.md), a user gets a [SID](./authorization.md#sid) and an authentication token.

        - {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster uses a [SID](./authorization.md#sid) for user identification. For example, a SID for an internal user is the user login. SIDs for external users also include information about the system where they were created. User SIDs can also be found in [system views](../dev/system-views.md#auth) describing the security configuration.

        - The authentication token is used by {{ydb-short-name }} nodes to authorize user access before processing user requests.

            The user can then use the received authentication token repeatedly when making requests to the {{ydb-short-name }} cluster. For more information about the authentication token and related configuration parameters, see [{#T}](../reference/configuration/auth_config.md).

    - **Authorization**. Based on the authentication data, a user then goes through [authorization](./authorization.md) â€” a process that verifies whether a user has sufficient [access rights](../concepts/glossary.md#access-right) and [access levels](../concepts/glossary.md#access-level) to perform user operations.

- **Audit logs**. {{ ydb-short-name }} provides [audit logs](./audit-log.md) that include data about all operations that attempted to change the {{ ydb-short-name }} objects, such as changing access rights, creating or deleting scheme objects, whether successful or not. Audit logs are intended for people responsible for information security.

- **Encryption**. {{ ydb-short-name }} is a distributed system typically running on a cluster, often spanning multiple datacenters. To protect user data, {{ ydb-short-name }} provides the following technologies:

    - [encryption in transit](./encryption/data-in-transit.md) to secure data transmitted between a client and {{ ydb-short-name }}, and between nodes of the {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster.

    - [data encryption at rest](./encryption/data-at-rest.md).
